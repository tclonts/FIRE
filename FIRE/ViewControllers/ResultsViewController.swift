You could reach finacial independence when you are \(age?.description ?? "?") years old. \n\nAre you sitting on cloud 9 or down in the dumps? Now you have a snapshot into your future if things remain the same. If you like how things are trending, good work! Keep it up! If you don't like what you see, the good news is, you are in full control of your financial future. \n\nThe goal is to grow the gap between your income and expenses. That means finding ways to earn more, spend less, or a combination of the two. Start today by taking the '1% Challenge,' ask yourself, how can I improve my money situation by 1%? Then all you need to do is continue this simple process until you are happy with your timeline to financial independence.\n\nGood luck, and check out Mr. Fi Guy "
